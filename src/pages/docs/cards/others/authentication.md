title: 'Authentication'
---

When you use a [pro](/#pricing) plan, you have to pass your API key in order to [authenticate](/docs/api/basics/authentication) as part of the request to be authenticated against [Microlink API](/docs/api/getting-started/overview).

That should be done carefully: If you do that publicly, youâ€™re compromising your credentials to be leaked by anyone.

In order to prevent that, the authentication step should be done on the backend side. Check our repositories [proxy](https://github.com/microlinkhq/proxy) and [edge-proxy](https://github.com/microlinkhq/edge-proxy) to accomplish that, only allowing a list of well-known domains to consume your API quota.

After that, just pass your proxy URL as `endpoint` query parameter.
