The generated image can be consumed directly from markup. Just place the URL as Open Graph, JSON+LD or regular metadata as part of your content.

The interface suggest you the code snippet to use; It should be more than enough.

The first request will generate the image on the fly; the successive requests will consume the image from the cache using [Microlink CDN](/blog/edge-cdn/).

Cached requests don't impact your plan quota. See [pricing](/docs/cards/others/pricing) for more information.
