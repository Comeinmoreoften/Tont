**Microlink SDK** is the way to consume [Microlink API](/docs/api/getting-started/overview) directly from your UI, enabling beauty link previews for any link, designed with three things in mind:

- **Common surface**: Although they may have different interface API, every specific integration has the same functionalities.
- **Lightweight & fast**: The bundle size tends to be equal or less than 10KB (no polyfills included).
- **Customizable style**: At least you can customize style using universal CSS classes present on the markup.

You can convert any link present in your markup

[youtube.com/watch?v=9P6rdqiybaw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9P6rdqiybaw)

into a beautiful preview

<Microlink 
  url='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9P6rdqiybaw' 
  media='image' 
/>

**Microlink SDK** can detect video, audio or image automagically. Also, it supports some customizable things, like [size](/docs/sdk/parameters/size/).

<Microlink 
  url='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9P6rdqiybaw' 
  media='video' 
  size='large' 
/>

or resolve into embed when is possible

  <Microlink 
    url='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9P6rdqiybaw' 
    media='iframe' 
  />
