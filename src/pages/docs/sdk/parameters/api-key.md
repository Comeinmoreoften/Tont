The API Key associated with your plan for [authenticating](/docs/api/basics/authentication) your requests.

When you do not attach an API Key, you are going to use the free quota until you reach the daily rate limit.

To get a better daily quota, you'll need to have a plan. See [pricing](/#pricing) to know the plans.

After payment, you'll recieve the API key (via email) that you need to attach to authenticate requests.
